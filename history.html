                    <p style="color: white;">
                        Synthetic aperture radar(SAR) is a form of radar that is used to create images of objects, such
                        as landscapes- these images can be either two or three dimensional representations of the
                        object.

                        spectrum
                        is known as microwave remote sensing.<br>
                        → SAR remote sensing is an imaging active microwave remote sensing technique which provides
                        higher spatial resolution data.

                            Synthetic Aperture Radar, which was developed in the 1950s as a military reconnaissance
                            tool, was a solution to the 1940s need for an all-weather, 24-hour aerial remote
                            surveillance device the United States Army was looking for an aerial reconnaissance tool
                            which could see through clouds and would not depend on the hours of daylight.

                            Carl Wiley, working at Goodyear, Arizona, (which later became Goodyear Aerospace, and
                            eventually Lockheed Martin Corporation) in 1951, suggested the principle that — because each
                            object in the radar beam has a slightly different speed relative to the antenna — each
                            object will have its own doppler shift. A precise frequency analysis of the radar
                            reflections will thus allow the construction of a detailed image.

                                    Leith was born in 1927 in Detroit, MI, the site of Wayne State
                                    University where he would earn a BS in 1950, his MS in physics in 1952, and his

                                    It was at the University of Michigan's Willow Run Research Center in the

                                    The concept behind radar-wave phase reconstruction inspired Leith to explore

                                    reconstruction for optical processing improvement. Although Dennis Gabor had

                            dramatic results, and the University of Michigan system had proven itself.

                            Seasat was the first Earth-orbiting satellite designed for remote sensing of the Earth's
                            oceans and had on board one of
                            the first spaceborne synthetic-aperture radar (SAR). The mission was designed to demonstrate
                            the feasibility of global
                            satellite monitoring of oceanographic phenomena and to help determine the requirements for

                            Seasat was managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and was launched on 27 June 1978 into
                            a nearly circular 800 km (500 mi) orbit with an inclination of 108°.[2] Seasat operated
                            until 10 October 1978 (UTC),[1] when a massive short circuit in the Agena-D bus electrical
