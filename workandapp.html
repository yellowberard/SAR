                        <p style="color: white;">
                            Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) refers to a technique for producing fine-resolution images from a
                            resolution-limited radar system. It requires that the radar be moving in a straight line, either
                            on
                            an airplane or,rocket. The basic principle of any imaging radar is to emit an electromagnetic
                            signal
                            (which travels at the speed of light) toward a surface and record the amount of signal that
                            bounces/echoes back, or “backscatters,” and it's time delay. <br><br>
                            The SAR works similar to a phased array, but contrary to a large number of the parallel antenna
                            elements of a phased
                            array, SAR uses one antenna in time-multiplex. The different geometric positions of the antenna
                            elements are the result
                            of the moving platform now. <br><br>
                            The wavelengths that remote sensing radars use to observe Earth’s surface are microwaves,
                            typically in the range of a few to tens of centimetres. Because the radar signal loses energy as
                            it travels – at a rate equivalent to the beam width (wavelength / antenna size) – by the time it
                            hits the surface, the beam has spread dramatically. For example, with a signal wavelength of 10
                            centimeters and an antenna of 10 meters in diameter, the beam width is 1/100 radians (0.6
                            degrees). <br><br>
                            From an altitude of 1,000 kilometers, the resulting beam width on the ground becomes a
                            very large 10 km, producing an image resolution which is insufficient for most applications. SAR
                            is the solution to this dilemma as it can vastly improve the resolution. <br><br>
                            SAR techniques take advantage of the fact that the radar is moving in orbit to synthesize a
                            virtual 10-km-long antenna from the physical 10-m antenna in the direction of flight. As the
                            radar moves along its path, it sweeps the antenna’s footprint across the ground while
                            continuously transmitting pulses – short signal bursts separated by time – and receiving the
                            echoes of the returned pulses. <br><br>
                            As a target (like a ship) first enters the radar beam, the backscattered echoes from each
                            transmitted pulse begin to be
                            recorded. As the platform continues to move forward, all echoes from the target for each pulse
                            are recorded during the
                            entire time that the target is within the beam. The point at which the target leaves the view of
                            the radar beam some
                            time later, determines the length of the simulated or synthesized antenna. The synthesized
                            expanding beamwidth, combined
                            with the increased time a target is within the beam as ground range increases, balances each
                            other, such that the
                            resolution remains constant across the entire swath. <br><br>
                            The SAR-processor stores all the radar returned signals, as amplitudes and phases, for the time
                            period T from position A to D. Now it is possible to reconstruct the signal which would have
                            been obtained by an antenna of length v · T, where v is the platform speed. As the line of sight
                            direction changes along the radar platform trajectory, a synthetic aperture is produced by
                            signal processing that has the effect of lengthening the antenna. Making T large makes the
                            „synthetic aperture” large and hence a higher resolution can be achieved

                                Two technologies can be applied to generate DEM that are stereo SAR and interferometric sar.
                                Stereo sar uses the parallax of sar pair to generate DEM;
                                Interferometric sar uses the different phases of two sar images to estimate the surface
                                height.
                                A DEM for a large area can be generated without the need of ground control or a few control

                                Soil dielectric constant is calculated through the sar backscattering signals.
                                The soil moisture content can be estimated by the soil dielectric constant.
                                The accuracy of the estimated result depends on the SAR wavelength, the polarization used.
                                It is useful for irrigation monitoring as well as environmental monitoring.
