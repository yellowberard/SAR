                        Radar antennas send and receive polarized energy. This means that the pulse of energy is
                        filtered so that its electrical
                        wave vibrations are only in a single plane that is perpendicular to the direction of travel.the
                        pulse of electromagnetic
                        energy sent out by the antenna may be vertically or horizontally polarized.

                        <p>
                            SAR Polarimetry is the science of acquiring, processing and analysing the polarisation state
                            of an electromagnetic field. SAR polarimetry is concerned with the utilization of
                            polarimetry
                            in SAR applications.<br><br>
                            By varying the polarization of the transmitted signal and receiving several different
                            polarized images from the same series of pulses, SAR systems can gather detailed information
                            on the polarimetric properties of the observed surface, which can reveal the structure,
                            orientation and environmental conditions of the surface elements.
                            For example, linearly oriented structures such as buildings or ripples in the sand tend to
                            reflect and preserve the coherence (same linear direction) of the polarimetric signal

                            Speckle is a granular interference that inherently exists in and degrades the quality of the
                            active radar, synthetic
                            aperture radar (SAR), medical ultrasound and optical coherence tomography images. ... It is
                            caused by coherent
                            processing of backscattered signals from multiple distributed targets.
                            The vast majority of surfaces, synthetic or natural, are extremely rough on the scale of the
                            wavelength. Images obtained
                            from these surfaces by coherent imaging systems such as laser, SAR, and ultrasound suffer
                            from a common interference
                            phenomenon called speckle.<br><br>
                            Speckle results from these patterns of constructive and destructive interference shown as
                            bright and dark dots in the
                            image.Speckle in conventional radar increases the mean grey level of a local area.[3]Speckle
                            in SAR is generally
                            serious, causing difficulties for image interpretation.[3][4] It is caused by coherent
                            processing of backscattered
                            signals from multiple distributed targets. In SAR oceanography, for example, speckle is
                            caused by signals from
                            elementary scatterers, the gravity-capillary ripples, and manifests as a pedestal image,
                            beneath the image of the sea

                            Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is an effective way to measure changes in
                            land surface altitude. InSAR makes high-density measurements over large areas by using radar
                            signals from Earth-orbiting satellites to measure changes in land-surface altitude at high
                            degrees of measurement resolution and spatial detail (Galloway and others,
                            2000).<br><br>Synthetic
                            Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is produced by reflecting radar signals off a target area and
                            measuring the two-way travel time back to the satellite. The SAR interferometry technique
                            uses two SAR images of the same area acquired at different times and "interferes"
                            (differences) them, resulting in maps called interferograms that show ground-surface
                            displacement (range change) between the two time periods.

                        <p>InSAR is ideally suited to measure the spatial extent and magnitude of surface deformation
                            associated with fluid extraction and natural hazards (earthquakes, volcanoes, landslides).
                            It is often less expensive than obtaining sparse point measurements from labor-intensive
                            spirit-leveling and global positioning system (GPS) surveys, and can provide millions of
                            data points in a region about 10,000 square kilometers.<br><br> By identifying specific
                            areas of
                            deformation within broader regions of interest, InSAR imagery can also be used to better
                            position specialized instrumentation (such as extensometers, GPS networks, and leveling
                            lines) designed to precisely measure and monitor surface deformation over limited areas.
